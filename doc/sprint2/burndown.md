## Burndown:



## Velocity:

For sprint 2 we have 304 points which was the way more than the sprint 1 velocity, 136. Since our team choose to work during the reading week, which make this sprint 2 a bit longer. Additionally, more of our team members were learning Angular to help implement the frontend interface. Therefore, we had double the story points comparing to sprint 1.
