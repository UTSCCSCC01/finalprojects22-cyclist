## Goal of sprint 2

## User Stories

1. (CYC-46): As a user, I want to register an account with my email account
2. (CYC-47): As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can use the app from where I left off.
3. (CYC-58): As a user, I want to view my tasks on the daily view page, which displays tasks in the next 7 days.
4. (CYC-59): As a user, I want to view my tasks on a monthly log, as a list, so that I remember to schedule them later.
5. (CYC-62): As a user, I want to view my list of unscheduled tasks on a future log, so that I remember to schedule them later.
6. (CYC-30): As a user, I want to modify a task (scheduled time, task name, description) so that I can reschedule it.
7. (CYC-33): As a user, I want to mark a task with different signifiers (task completion, important task, …) so that I can better focus at the moment.
8. (CYC-31): As a user, I want to set a task to be repeated regularly (like every Monday, the task will have a unique signifier) so that it is convenient to create the same tasks for different days.
9.  (CYC-35): As a user, I want to create task groups (with possible start and end dates) containing a set of tasks and set colors and icons for them so that I can have a better visual representation of related tasks.
