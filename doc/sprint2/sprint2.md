## Goal of sprint 2

For Sprint2, the frontend team will focus on implementing more features for the
app, the backend team will focus on adding more fields into the database more
features, the QA team will focus on testing whether all the user stories our
team want to complete in sprint2 works well. Our team will focus on completing
user stories CYC-46, CYC-47, CYC-58, CYC-59, CYC-32, CYC-35 and CYC-62. At the
end of Sprint2, we want to have a web app for users to see the task groups in
the side bar, Daily Log, Monthly Log and Future Log and switch between each
view, can add tasks and see them show on the corresponded views and be able to
reschedule tasks.
