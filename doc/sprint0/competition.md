# Competing apps of CycList

## Introduction
CycList is a bullet journaling app made for users to jog down and organize their tasks and notes. It is a mixture of to-do, journaling, calendar, and stats tracking tools. 
Of course, there are other apps that achieve similar functions. There is Google Calendars, Microsoft todo, Periodically, TickTick, and Sectograph, just to name a few. 
CycList is different from the typical todo, calendar, and prediction tools because it offers a combination of all three, and presents a simple task management system to guide users on staying focused.
Below are 3 case studies of competing apps and why CycList is different and stands out.

## MS Todo
MS Todo is a todo list app for users to organize their tasks. Similar to CycList, MS Todo allows users to add, view, and organize tasks, and allows users to view completed tasks. 
CycList is more than a todo list app because it tracks the user’s task completion times and mood for each task, then gives time suggestions on new tasks, based on the recorded task completion times.

Users who want to learn about themselves and improve over time can use CycList’s task completion and mood tracking feature to review their performance and discover which tasks they like and/or need to improve upon.
On the other hand, MS Todo focuses on task planning and doesn't offer any features for tracking task completion times and mood. This is probably because MS Todo is an app that serves everyone with a Microsoft account and mood tracking isn’t a need for everyone. As a result, MS Todo is a generic to-do list app.

## Google Calendar
Google Calendar is a calendar app for users to add and visualize events on a calendar. Google Calendar also has a tasks list, where users can record tasks with no specified time. 
Similarly in CycList, users can record tasks and visualize them on a timeline, on the future log page.
The timeline visualization is different between CycList and Google Calendar because CycList doesn’t show time of day information on its timeline, whereas Google Calendar shows time of day.

CycList aims to simplify the user’s view of their tasks and events. Rather than presenting tasks and events on a grid (as in Google’s Calendar’s week and month views), CycList presents tasks on a line, where users can focus on the nearest upcoming tasks, displayed at the top. 
This is useful for users who want to get things done or have trouble focusing on the tasks at hand because CycList simplifies the task adding and viewing to guide users to not spend much time in creating tasks, but spend more time actually completing them.
Google Calendar mostly helps plan long term events and schedules, therefore the tasks list feature is more of an add-on. A new app needs to be developed in order for Google to have a genuine to-do app.

## Periodically
Periodically lets users add daily events for them to track which days they completed each event. Then, the app makes predictions on which day the user will next complete each event. This feature is very similar to the task completion tracking and suggestions feature in CycList. In CycList, users can track the time they took to complete each task. Based on the task completion data, the app will predict how long the user will complete a similar task and give suggestions on how long the user should plan to complete it.

The difference between Periodically and CycList is: Periodically forces users to set daily tasks to be tracked, while CycList will track any type of tasks, recurring or not.
The feature of tracking and giving suggestions to generic tasks helps the users to set more realistic times for their tasks. The feature also aids users to make their plans faster, so they can spend less time planning and more time working.
