# Motivation
This project is a bullet journal to help you building your daily schedule, you can add tasks and notes to the journal to avoid missing an important meeting or assignment deadline and so on. It also provide a suggestion with suggested start time, expecting end time and the day it should be started based on your past experience when you create a new task. If you have too many tasks at the same time thus forget to attend an important appointment, we will rememeber it for you. If you don't have a clear plan about what should I do in the next few days, we will make a personalized suggestion based on you. Since many journal apps in the market cannot give a suggestion, we are here to make your life eaiser. That's the reason we exist.
