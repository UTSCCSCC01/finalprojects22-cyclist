## Roles/Team organization

The rest of the group memebers are refered as "developers"

The managers remain at their position while the rest of the group members (developers) can switch their roles and pair with a manager at the end of each sprint . This allows inexperienced group members to have a broader developing skills.

## Decision Making

- If there is a implimentation problem:
  - If you are a developer
    - then you should discuss it your problem to the manager of your department.
  - If you are a manager
    - report to the product owner and call a group meeting, and try to solve it.
    - If the entire group fail to sovle
      - Ask TAs/instructor
