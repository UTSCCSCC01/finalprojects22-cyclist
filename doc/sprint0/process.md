# Process

## Roles/Team organization

| Role             | Name          |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Product Owner    | Tianpai Zhang |
| QA Manager       | Jeffrey       |
| Frontend Manager | Andrew        |
| Backend Manager  | Daniel        |

The rest of the group members are referred to as "developers"

The managers remain at their position while the rest of the group members (developers) can switch their roles and pair with a manager at the end of each sprint. This allows inexperienced group members to gain broader developing skills.

## Decision Making

- If there is an implementation problem:
  - If you are a developer
    - then you should discuss your problem with the manager of your department.
  - If you are a manager
    - report to the product owner and call a group meeting, and try to solve it.
    - If the entire group fails to solve
      - Ask TAs/instructor
- If it is a design choice regarding (UI/UX)
  - contact the product owner directly.
- else
  - contact the product owner and call a group meeting.

## Prioritizing User Stories

Our team will prioritize our user stories together. A user story will be broken down by the entire group first. Then, it is passed down to the corresponding department, frontend or backend group, and further split into functions with more implementation details.

## Meetings

| Day       | Time           | Location |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Monday    | 18:00 to 19:00 | IC406    |
| Wednesday | 19:00 to 21:00 | Discord  |
| Friday    | 14:00 to 16:00 | IC406    |

The meeting agenda is available one day in advance.

## Next Phase

- Hold more in-person meetings.
  - Zoom meeting with the camera on may yield a more efficient outcome than Discord voice chat.
- Make sure everyone has some tasks to work on. 
- Work as a team together.
  - Hold good ideas until the product owner is on this topic.
