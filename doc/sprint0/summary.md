while hoping for a healthy life style.

wrong era.

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1:

Wanda Maximoff started to lose control over her life when exam season is coming
up soon. She not only found her study is behind but also life is is a whirlpool.
She can hardly find any time to relax and always anxious. She needs some
motivation and see long improvement in her university life.

### Scenario 2:

Steve Rogers spent hours just to find a simple but powerful planning tool that
allow task categorization with hierarchy for the government projects. Many
projects requires negotiation with third party suppliers but it is hard to
arrange meetings for a specific date until a few days before the meeting.
Although, Steve put unconfirmed dates on a yellow sticker note inside his
notebook, it is still hard to keep track of each and every unconfirmed date with
different suppliers.

### Scenario 3:

Michelle’s largest goal is to succeed in high school. But She sometimes got
overwhelmed by courses assignments. She has to spend a lot time planning and
tracking her mood and task difficulty everyday in order to graph the statics.
This usually takes hours to graph. Although, she loves to see the long term
performance, a digital planner that can suggest her the best to work on
assignments and figure out which tasks are related and depended on.

## Key Principle:

1. Task hierarchy and dependency over detailed planning.
2. Never show too many tasks at once: Providing an overview to users is
   essential, but the side effect is to overwhelm users.
3. Don't allow user to plan far in the future: focus on today and plan for the
   next 3 days. There is no reason to remember a important event which will take
   place in 3 months.
4. As little design as possible: good UI/UX design elevates the essential
   functionalities
5. Make users to evaluate their performance.
