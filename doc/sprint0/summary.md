# Summary

## Objectives

The bullet journal app is designed to help users to have better
self-realization and mental preparation when planning daily tasks out, 
have a more productive and efficient working routine or lifestyle, and 
make life easier and manageable.

## Key Personas

### Persona 1:

Wanda Maximoff, a 20-year old female university student, loves to keep herself
busy with a wide range of topics, whether it be coding, watching tv, writing
stories, or building a business. She has to work under pressure for long time
while hoping for a healthy life style.

### Persona 2:

Steve Rogers, a 35-year old male team manager, works for the government in
managing community projects. He is a passionate and motivating leader but he
sometimes struggles to keep up with the times and feels like he is living in the
wrong era.

### Persona 3:

Michelle Jones Watson, a student and a young team member of Steve, likes to keep
up with various blogs, news articles, and political commentators. Michelle’s largest
goal is to succeed in high school.

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1:

Wanda Maximoff started to lose control over her life when exam season was approaching.
She not only found that she was behind in her studies but also that life was a whirlpool.
She could hardly find any time to relax and was always anxious. She needed some
motivation to see improvements in her university life so she decided to plan her
tasks day by day to make incremental progress.

### Scenario 2:

Steve Rogers spent hours just to find a simple but powerful planning tool that
allowed task categorization with hierarchy for all the government projects he 
had been assigned. Many projects required negotiation with third party suppliers,
but it was hard to arrange meetings for a specific date until a few days before the meeting.
Although Steve put unconfirmed dates on a yellow sticky note inside his
notebook, it was still hard to keep track of each and every unconfirmed date with
different suppliers.

### Scenario 3:

Michelle’s largest goal was to succeed in high school, but she sometimes got
overwhelmed by courses assignments. She had to spend a lot time planning and
tracking her mood and task difficulty everyday in order to graph the statistics,
which usually took hours. Although she loves to see her long term performance, 
she wished for a digital planner that would plot out her task statistics for her and 
would use it to make suggestions on what would best for her to work on next, 
taking into consideration which tasks are related to each other and which depend on others.

## Key Principle:

1. Task hierarchy and dependency over detailed planning.
2. Never show too many tasks at once: Providing an overview to users is
   essential, but the side effect is to overwhelm users.
3. Don't allow user to plan far in the future: focus on today and plan for the
   next 5 days. There is no reason to remember a important event which will take
   place in 3 months.
4. As little design as possible: good UI/UX design elevates the essential
   functionalities
5. Make users to evaluate their performance.
