# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

Location and date: June 2 on Discord

## Sprint Goals

For Sprint1, the frontend team will focus on learning Angular for building the app, the backend team will focus on doing the basic setup related to the database for the project, the QA team will focus on testing whether all the user stories our team want to complete in sprint1 work well. Our team will focus on completing user stories CYC-63, CYC-60, CYC-27, CYC-38 and CYC-66. At the end of Sprint1, we want to have a web app by which users can see the navigation bars for Dashboard, Daily Log, Monthly Log and Future Log and switch between each view, can add tasks and see them show on the Dashboard page in a consistent format and can change to the dark mode.

## User Stories

Sprint 1 user stories to be completed

- CYC-63: As a frontend developer, I want to learn Angular so that I can start

    clicking the add button and completing the task template.
- CYC-38: As a user, I want to use it in the dark mode so that I can comfortably
  use it at night. (~ 0.5hrs)
  - create a dark mode color version for the web app
