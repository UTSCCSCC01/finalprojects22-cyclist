### Release goals
The release goal is to create a web application which help people plan tasks more efficient and focus on completing them rather than planning. 

## Scope 
### Accomplishment goals for Sprint 1:

1. CYC-63: As a frontend developer, I want to learn Angular so that I can start my project. 
2. CYC-60: As a user, I want to use a sidebar to switch between each view (daily log, monthly log, and future log).
3. CYC-27:As a user, I want to press an add button to input information about a new task, and create the new task.
4. CYC-58: As a user, I want to view my tasks on the daily view page, which displays tasks in the next 7 days.
5. CYC-38: As a user, I want to use it in the dark mode so that I can comfortably use it at night.
6. CYC-46: As a user, I want to register an account with my email account.
7. CYC-47: As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can use the app from where I left off.

### Accomplishment goals for Sprint 2:

1. CYC-30: As a user, I want to modify a task (scheduled time, task name, description) so that I can reschedule it.
2. CYC-31: As a user, I want to set a task to be repeated regularly (like every Monday, the task will have a unique signifier) so that it is convenient to create the same tasks for different days.
3. CYC-59: As a user, I want to view my tasks on a monthly log, as a list, so that I remember to schedule them later.
4. CYC-62: As a user, I want to view my list of unscheduled tasks on a future log, so that I remember to schedule them later.
5. CYC-28: As a user, I want to add, update, and delete sub-tasks to tasks (one layer of sub-tasks only) so that I can break down my tasks to complete them easier.

### Accomplishment goals for Sprint 3:

1. CYC-43: As a user, I want to see my achievements so that I can focus on completing them to increase my success rate.
2. CYC-45: As a user, I want the app to remind me to review my tasks in daily, monthly & future log so that I practice reviewing my tasks.
3. CYC-64: As a user, I want to suggest a duration time for each task I create.
4. CYC-33: As a user, I want to mark a task with different signifiers (task completion, important task, …) so that I can better focus at the moment.
5. CYC-34: As a user, I want to rate my task with a (optional) difficulty score so that I can track how well I perform.

### Accomplishment goals for Sprint 4:

1. CYC-40: As a user, I want to track my mood for each task and have the app generate the mood for me based on the mood of the tasks of that day so that I see which tasks I like to do.
2. CYC-57: As a developer, I want to suggest to users how difficult a task is based on previous difficulty score when the user is doing similar tasks.
3. CYC-41: As a user, I want the app to track my location and record my commute times so that I can better plan for my commute for future tasks.
4. CYC-42: As a user, I want the app to surprise me with hidden achievements via notifications so that I can stay motivated to use this app and plan for the future.
5. CYC-39: As a user, I want the app to track my task completion rate so that I understand my actual ability to complete the task.
