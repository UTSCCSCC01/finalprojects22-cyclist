# Sprint 2: Schedule

![schedule](./asset/schedule.png)

The diagram is structured top to bottom and left to right. Circles indicate user
stories and rounded rectangles are subtasks of the user stories on the same row.
The arrowed lines indicate the dependencies.  The
unlinked subtasks in rounded rectangles mean that they are flexible and can be
implemented anytime for that user story. And the intended order of
implementation is preferred to be from left to right on each row and top to
bottom for each user story if not linked, otherwise, the order should follow the
critical path. We prioritized the tasks that located at the start of each
critical path in order to minimize the delay of Sprint3 and keep the team on
schedule.



## What do we do to keep our sprint on schedule:

1. Have frequent meeting on Discord
2. Set up GitHub webhook in our Discord server
3. Update Jira right after a task in completed
4. Post update or question in Discord `#team-update` channel
5. Have a Google Doc to keep track of all TODOs.
