# Burndown

1. Our graph looks flat at the beginning because testing is one of the subtasks
   which need to the last one. We really want to make sure all features works
   before marking them done.
2. We also planned to do QA tests before anyone can mark a user story as
   completed. That is also the reason our burn down went straight down at the
   end.

# Velocity:

For sprint 3, we had 544 points which was the way more than the sprint 2
velocity, 304. One reason is that this sprint is for us to polish, debug and
improve user experience further. Therefore, we have a lot more points that sprint 2.
