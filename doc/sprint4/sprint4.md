# Sprint 4

JUL 18, 2022, on Discord

## Goal of sprint 4

For Sprint4, our team will focus on polishing the app even further besides
completing user stories CYC-149, CYC-37, CYC-45, CYC-64, CYC-39. At the end of
Sprint4, users will have a complete experience of our Bullet Journal App. Users
are able to set notification, see overdue tasks, view next 6 days weather,
obtain suggested duration time for a tasks after choosing a tag for a task, and
track completion rate of all tasks on Dashboard. Overall, the app is
well-designed and implemented and ready to be deployed if needed.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want the dashboard page to display my overdue and completed
   tasks, so that I get reminded to complete the task.
2. As a user, I want to see the weather for each day beside each day’s entry in
   the daily log so that I can plan my tasks better with the weather in mind.
3. As a user, I want the app to notify me in advance so that I can have a better
   preparation of the task before it takes place.
4. As a user, I want to suggest a duration time for each task I create.
5. As a user, I want the app to track my task completion rate so that I
   understand my actual ability to complete the task.
