completing user stories CYC-30, CYC-33, CYC-128, CYC-129, CYC-152. At the end of

bar, Daily Log, Monthly Log and Future Log and switch between each view, can add
tasks anywhere and see them show on the corresponded views and be able to
reschedule tasks. Overall, out team use this sprint3 to debug and improve user
