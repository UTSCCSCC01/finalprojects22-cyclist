# Burndown

Our burndown chart for sprint 4 is flat for the first half of the sprint, then steped down fairly regularly in the second half of the sprint. In the first half of the sprint, the team had less time to work on the featues due to Assignment 2, which overlapped with Sprint 4. After the assignment, the team is able to focus solely on implementing the features. One by one, the features are implemented and the burndown chart steps down at a reliable rate in the second half of sprint 4.

# Velocity:

For sprint 4, we planned 448 story points which was the slightly less than the story points for sprint 3, 544. Our velocity decreased because sprint 4 is the last sprint and we want to do a good job on it. Sprint 4 is used to polishing up our applicaiton and improving the user experience. By having less story points, the team can focus more of their energy on tying up the loose ends and get ready for the final presentation.
